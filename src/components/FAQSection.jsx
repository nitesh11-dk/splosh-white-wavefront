      question: "What is Blockchain?",
      answer: "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. It provides transparency, security, and decentralization without the need for intermediaries."
    },
    {
      question: "What is SPLOSH?",
      answer: "SPLOSH is a 100% decentralized DAO-driven community platform built with blockchain and smart contracts. It focuses on identifying and supporting promising startups through decentralization, creating a sustainable ecosystem for innovation and community prosperity."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Decentralization?",
      answer: "Decentralization refers to the distribution of power, control, and decision-making away from a central authority. In blockchain and cryptocurrency contexts, it means that no single entity controls the network, making it more democratic, transparent, and resistant to censorship."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Smart Contract?",
      answer: "A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically executes when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring trustless, transparent transactions."
